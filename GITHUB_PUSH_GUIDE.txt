# 🚀 How to Push This Project to GitHub

Your project is now ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

---

## STEP 1: Create a Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name your repository: `Job-Recommendation-System` (or any name you like)
3. Add description: "Full-Stack Job Recommendation System for Freshers using Flask, SQLite, and HTML/CSS/JS"
4. Choose visibility: **Public** (for portfolio) or **Private** (for personal)
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (you already have one)
6. Click **Create Repository**

---

## STEP 2: Copy the Remote URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Look for the HTTPS URL:

Example: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Job-Recommendation-System.git`

---

## STEP 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Run this command in terminal (replace with your URL):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Job-Recommendation-System.git
```

Verify it worked:
```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see:
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Job-Recommendation-System.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Job-Recommendation-System.git (push)
```

---

## STEP 4: Push to GitHub

Run this command:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

This will:
- Rename master branch to main (GitHub default)
- Push all files to GitHub
- Set main as default branch

---

## STEP 5: Verify on GitHub

1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Job-Recommendation-System`
2. You should see all your files
3. Check that README.md displays properly

2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Name: "Push to Repo"
4. Select: repo checkbox
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token
7. When Git asks for password, paste the token instead

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin YOUR_NEW_URL
```
